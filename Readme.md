# Expected Correlations
These tracts are correlated with performance in a way that suggests higher level of connectivity  (positive AD/QA, negative MD/RD) 

## Quantitative Anisotropy

# Opposite direction correlations

## Quantitative Anisotropy

### Both Sexes
Negative QA correlations were identified for the combined sexes, but this is likely due to negative correlations in the female cohort.  Negative QA correlations for combined sexes are shown in yellow, while negative QA correlations for females are overlayed in blue.

### Females
Positive correlations identified in males (the expected direction for higher performance) are shown in red for reference.
Negative correlations (opposite of what would be expected with higher connectivity) identified in females are overlayed in blue.

## Mean Diffusivity 

### Both Sexes/Males
Positive correlations with mean diffusivity were identified in the combined sex analysis, and are very similar to positive MD correlations identified in the male cohort.  Positive MD correlations for both sexes are shown in red, and positive MD correlations for males are overlayed in yellow
