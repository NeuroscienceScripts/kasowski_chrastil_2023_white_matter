# Expected Correlations
These tracts are correlated with performance in a way that suggests higher level of connectivity  (positive AD/QA, negative MD/RD) 

## Quantitative Anisotropy
# Both Sexes

# Males

# Females

# Opposite direction correlations

## Quantitative Anisotropy

## Both Sexes
Negative QA correlations were identified 

Positive correlations identified in males (the expected direction for higher performance) are shown in red.
Negative correlations (opposite of what would be expected with higher connectivity) identified in females are overlayed in blue.
